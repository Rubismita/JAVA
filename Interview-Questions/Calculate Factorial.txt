Coding Exercise: Calculate Factorial Of a Number
In this problem, you are tasked with completing the implementation of a FactorialCalculator class in Java that calculates the factorial of a given number.

The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. The factorial function can be defined by the product:

n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1

For example,

4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24

3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6

2! = 2 * 1 = 2

1! = 1

0! is defined to be 1

If the input is negative, return -1 as the factorial for negative numbers is undefined.

Here is the skeleton of the FactorialCalculator class:

public class FactorialCalculator {
 
    public int calculateFactorial(int number) {
        // Write your code here
    }
}
Task

Your task is to implement the calculateFactorial(int number) method in the FactorialCalculator class.

calculateFactorial(int number) - This method will take one parameter, number (an integer), and it should calculate the factorial of this number. If the input number is negative, it should return -1.

Examples

Here are some examples of how your FactorialCalculator class should behave once implemented:

FactorialCalculator calculator = new FactorialCalculator();
 
System.out.println(calculator.calculateFactorial(5));    // Output: 120
System.out.println(calculator.calculateFactorial(4));    // Output: 24
System.out.println(calculator.calculateFactorial(3));    // Output: 6
System.out.println(calculator.calculateFactorial(2));    // Output: 2
System.out.println(calculator.calculateFactorial(1));    // Output: 1
System.out.println(calculator.calculateFactorial(0));    // Output: 1
System.out.println(calculator.calculateFactorial(-5));   // Output: -1
In the above examples, the factorial of each number is computed as described, and -1 is returned for the negative input as the factorial for negative numbers is undefined.



public class FactorialCalculator {

    public int calculateFactorial(int number) {
        // Write your code here
        if(number < 0){
            return -1;
        } 
        int factorial = 1;
        //2 to number
        
        for(int i = 2 ; i <= number ; i++){
            factorial = factorial * i;
        }
        return factorial;
    }
}
