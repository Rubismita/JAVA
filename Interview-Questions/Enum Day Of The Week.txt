Coding Exercise - Enum Day Of The Week
You are given an incomplete DaysOfWeek enum in Java.

The DaysOfWeek enum represents the seven days of the week: MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, and SUNDAY. Each day has a name represented as a string.

Your task is to complete the following methods:

getName(): This method should return the name of the day.

isWeekday(): This method should return true if the day is a weekday (i.e., Monday to Friday), and false otherwise.

isHoliday(): This method should return true if the day is a holiday (i.e., Saturday or Sunday), and false otherwise.

Detailed Examples

Example 1

Consider the day TUESDAY.

For the getName() method, the output should be "Tuesday".

For the isWeekday() method, the output should be true since Tuesday is a weekday.

For the isHoliday() method, the output should be false since Tuesday is not a holiday.

Example 2

Consider the day SATURDAY.

For the getName() method, the output should be "Saturday".

For the isWeekday() method, the output should be false since Saturday is not a weekday.

For the isHoliday() method, the output should be true since Saturday is a holiday.
